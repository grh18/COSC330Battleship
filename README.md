# COSC330Battleship
Iterative development of a Battleship game, programmed in Java and complete with a GUI and Networking.

## Overview
This project is developed iteratively across five stages, progressively building a fully functional networked Battleship game using Java. The application follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and features a drag-and-drop GUI interface.

## Development Stages

### Stage 0 – Exploration
Experiment with the networking code and explore the drag-and-drop technique. 

### Stage I – Design
Design the application using UML diagrams and sketches of the GUI interface.

### Stage II – Implementation
- Implement the **Model** component and test it thoroughly.
- Implement the **View** component, including drag-and-drop functionality, and test it thoroughly.

### Stage III – Integration
Combine the View and Model components via a **Controller** into a single application and test it thoroughly. 

### Stage IV – Networking
Incorporate the networking code and test the application across two computers.
